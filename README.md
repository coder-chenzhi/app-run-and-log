# app-run-and-log

This is the very basic automated testing pipeline for Android. Its only purpose 
is to find *healthy* apps and to filter out all the apps that could not be 
tested (therefore, not healthy) on your particular device or emulator. 
Not healthy apps affect the evaluation of dynamic analysis tools effectiveness.

**_Healthy_** app is the app that can be installed onto selected device and does
not crash upon startup.

# Testing flow

- install
- run the main activity or monkey
- uninstall
- report if the app failed to install or crashed upon startup time
- proceed with the next app

# Launching
1. Create config.py based on config.py.sample before launching the app.
2. Prepare device/emulator.

```shell
$ pip install -e .
$ app_run_and_log run <apk_path> # run a single app
```

# Examples

1.  Launch all apps from a directory.
```shell
$ app_run_and_log run_dir <input_dir> -o <output_dir> 
```
2. Run monkey on every app with 1000 events (see config.py for defaults).
```shell
$ app_run_and_log run_dir <input_dir> -o <output_dir> --monkey -e 1000
```
